<p class="bigger">This page is a placeholder to get things started with <strong>LEARN.JS.ORG</strong>. We hope to gather some JavaScript enthusiasts, willing to build up a comprehensive JavaScript compendium.</p>
<p>At the moment this project is in an early <a href="https://github.com/js-org/learn.js.org/issues/1">conceptional phase</a>. You won't find anything of interest here soon, but you may find some informations in the <a href="https://github.com/js-org/learn.js.org/wiki" rel="nofollow">wiki</a> or discussions in the <a href="https://github.com/js-org/learn.js.org/issues" rel="nofollow">issue section</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>If you can´t wait to learn JavaScript - and you shouldn´t - check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MDN - JavaScript Guide!</a></p>
<p>Already know JavaScript? Great, you can help <a href="https://github.com/js-org/learn.js.org/wiki/Curriculum-Outline" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">contribute to the curriculum!</a></p>
