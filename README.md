## About

The vision for learn.js.org is to build a unique JavaScript curriculum that leverages interactive examples to teach programming concepts that are informed by the real-world experience of world-class developers. Given the tremendous velocity of JavaScript evolution, this is something that is only possible with a community driven, dynamic curriculum. A freely accessible _"JavaScript: The Definitive Digital Guide"_ if you will.
